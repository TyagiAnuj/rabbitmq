The session is the way SQLAlchemy ORM interacts with the database.
It wraps a database connection via an engine,
and provides an identity map for objects that you load via the session
or associate with the session.
The identity map is a cache like data structure
that contains a unique list of objects determined by the objectâ€™s table
and primary key. A session also wraps a transaction,
and that transaction will be open until the Session is committed or rolled back
